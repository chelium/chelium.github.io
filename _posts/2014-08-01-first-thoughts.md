Today, I've finished the bulk of the website today. I'm considering adding an archive page later when I've accumulated enough posts to warrant doing so.

Jekyll is neat and simple. If you want to build a website with it, just look at example code on Github and read the documentation. I'll be working with it a lot more in the near future since I like using Github Pages.
