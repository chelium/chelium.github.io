I've finished the bulk of the website today. When enough posts are accumulated, I'll consider adding an archive page.

Jekyll is neat and simple. If you want to build a website with it, just look at example code on Github and read the documentation. I'll be working with it a lot more in the near future since I like using Github Pages.
